After a failed job that left him guilty over the death of his wife Mal, Cobb\u2019s criminal record is cleared if he can successfully perform an \u201cinception\u201d: planting an idea in a target\u2019s mind instead of extracting information. \n\nCobb is hired by industrialist Saito to implant the notion that Robert Fischer (Cillian\u202fMurphy) should dissolve his father\u2019s company. To achieve this, Cobb assembles a team\u2014Arthur (Joseph\u202fGordon\u2011Levitt), forger\u2011Eames (Tom\u202fHardy), chemist\u202fYusuf (Dileep\u202fRao), and architect\u2011student Ariadne (Elliot\u202fPage)\u2014and sedates Fischer onto a plane. They then descend through three nested dream levels: a city, a hotel, and an alpine fortress, each with its own rules of time and reality. While each member must remain on a different level to provide synchronized \u201ckicks\u201d (stun stimuli that wake dreamers) and maintain the dream\u2019s stability, they also confront Fischer\u2019s subconscious defenses, including projections of his godfather Peter Browning and the dangerous figure of Mal.\n\nComplications arise when Yusuf\u2019s sedative takes them into \u201cLimbo,\u201d a shared subconscious void where time stretches, forcing the team to improvise new kicks. During the descent, Mal\u2019s projection kills Fischer, and both Saito and Fischer are lost in Limbo. Cobb must rescue them while ensuring the inception can be carried out. On the final level, Fischer receives the planted idea of creating something of his own. The team synchronizes their kicks to return to reality; Cobb confronts Saito and resolves his guilt over Mal. The film ends with Cobb finally reuniting with his children, choosing not to test the dream\u2011top \u201ctotem\u201d and accepting that he has returned to the real world.","Inception follows Dom Cobb, a thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, as he is hired to plant an idea into a target's mind.",0.6676424742,false],["What company produced Inception?","**Inception was produced by Warner\u202fBros.
